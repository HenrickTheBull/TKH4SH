A modular telegram Python bot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Originally a marie fork, then on Kigy≈ç, H4SH will evolve over time for a non-anime network style community on Telegram.

Can be found on telegram as [H4SH](https://t.me/H4SH_GA_bot).

The Support group can be reached out to at [Grand Aurochs Software](https://t.me/GASoftware), where you can ask for help setting up your bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available.

- *Fill in all the vars*

- *Setup Virtual Enviroment for Python 3 and The Bot*
- *And finally inside the venv* `python3 -m tg_bot`

## Credits
